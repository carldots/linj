## linj
I have been holding a grudge for a long time. I will probably never get over the fact that my local public transport provider updated their app and made it worse for no apparent reason. Naturally as a normal human being i created a script to scrape timetables and routes to the terminal using the Trafiklab API. They never fix the app, not even a single faint of light.

## Dependencies (also listed in the flake.nix)
- requests
- python-dotenv
- dbus-python
